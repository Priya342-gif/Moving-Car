# 🚗 Moving Car Animation using HTML & CSS

This project creates a smooth animated scene where a car appears to drive through a moving city landscape. It is built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS animations**, with no JavaScript involved.

## 🎬 How It Works

- **Background Layers:**
  - `sky.jpg` – A fixed background representing the sky.
  - `road.jpg` – Horizontally scrolling image to simulate road movement.
  - `bg4.png` – City buildings that scroll slower for a parallax effect.

- **Car Structure:**
  - `car.png` – Positioned in the center-bottom, remains stationary.
  - `wheel.png` – Two wheels rotating to simulate movement.

- **CSS Animations:**
  - `@keyframes highway` – Scrolls the road to the left infinitely.
  - `@keyframes city` – Scrolls the buildings slowly.
  - `@keyframes wheel` – Rotates the wheels continuously.
  - `@keyframes car` – Adds slight shake for realism.
